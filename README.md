# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I will use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, I have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 
Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

Step 1: Preprocess the Data
Using my knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learn’s StandardScaler(), I will preprocess the dataset. 

Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
I will design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. 
I will compile, train, and evaluate my binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.

Step 3: Optimize the Model
I will optimize the model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 74%.

Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model
